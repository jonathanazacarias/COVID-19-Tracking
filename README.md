# COVID-19-Tracking
A project to track and model COVID-19 as it stands in most recent available data.

The purpose of this code is to look at and understand the recent Covid-19 virus outbreak based on most recent data from the top data sources including the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and tracking based on JHU and sources.
The intitial purpose of this repository will be to simply view recent data as it becomes available and to interpret it in the context of publicly available news sources and recent events. This will be done using common python libraries pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Additionaly models will be built off this data using sklearn to project the future growth and spread of the disease over time. The validity of these models will then be tested in the context of realworld data, recent events based on publicly available knowledge, and historical spread of other similar diseases.

These results will be shared in an accessible way on jonathanazacarias.com
